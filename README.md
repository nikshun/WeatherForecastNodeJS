# Weather Forecast NodeJS School Project

Created by Nikita Myshuniaiev on Mar 6, 2020.

The Weather Forecast NodeJS school project is a web application that helps people identify the weather of any region. Users just need to write a city name in the searchbox on the top right and they will be taken to the weather forecast page.

You can find the deployed version of the website at this URL: https://weather-forecaster.herokuapp.com/

## How to Use

To use the application, simply type the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the searchbox on the top right and click the "Search" button. You will be taken to the weather forecast page, where you can see the current weather conditions, as well as the forecast for the nearest future.

## Instruction to run

- Clone the repo
- Open terminal
- npm i
- npm run start
- Go to http://localhost:3000/

To host this project, you can use service called Heroku. All you have to do is connect your GitHub to Heroku and configure the production environment. After that, Heroku takes care of everything by itself and deploys th project in under a minute. Heroku will also enable automatic deployment for the pipeline you select. This means, any changes that will be pushed to Git will be updated almost immediately on the public facing server.

## Testing Instructions

1. Set up an Angular project. You can use the Angular CLI to create a new project.
2. Prepare your first test. Your new project comes with Angularâ€™s built-in testing tool ready. You can use Jasmine to write your test cases.
3. Create and set up a test suite.
4. Write a test to verify that the service and component integrate well.
5. Run the test.

## Future enhancements 

Any future enhancements and bug-fixing will be handled through Git. A separate branch needs to be created for every new feature/bug that is being worked on. The naming conventions for the branch should be as follows: featureId-featureName
